This is a dingbat font with over 45 glyph outlines of famous spaceships from TV and movies. Included are numerous spaceships from Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, Spacecruiser Yamato, Space 1999, 2001 A Space Odyssey and even the starfighter from Buck Rogers in the 23rd Centrury. Plus a few other surprises like Dr. Who's Tardis and the Serenity from the series Firefly. There are Imperials, and Rebels, and Klingons - oh my! Cylons and Romulans and Colonials, oh my! If they're big in spacecraft design, then you'll probably find them here in this font.

These glyph silouettes have mirrored counterpart glyphs between the upper and lower cases. Use of a character map program, such as Windows' Character Map, will be very helpful in exploring and using this font.
